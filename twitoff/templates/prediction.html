    <p>To assess how well the model actually performs,
      20% of the data for each user was left out of the training data.
      This unseen data can then be ran through the model,
      and the outcomes recorded. Since we know who wrote it,
      be can get a good idea of how well the model is performing.
      We can display our results in what is refered to as a Confusion Matrix,
      which is a table showing how many of the tweets for each user was
      predicted to be from any of them. In this case,
      the upper left quadrant represents how many tweets from {{ user0 }} was
      correctly predicted to written by them,
      and the upper right quedrant shows how many tweets from {{ uers0 }} was
      incorrectly predicted to be written by {{ user1 }}.
      In that way, a perfect model would be able to always assign each tweet
      to its original writter. But due to how much data is available,
      how that data is represented, or even the originality of the tweet, this
      is unlikely to happen unless the topics discussed have no
      relation to each other.
